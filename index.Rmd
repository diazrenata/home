Welcome! This is my personal website, currently under construction.

I am a community ecologist and macroecologist. I study distributions of individuals, biomass, and energy use in ecological communities, and how those distributions change over time and following disturbance. I use cross-taxa datasets and computationally intensive methods to look for common patterns that may hint at general processes, and I make extensive use of null models and simulations to disentangle "patterns" from randomness. I believe strongly in the importance of open science, and I work to implement and disseminate best practices for open, replicable, and reproducible computational research.
