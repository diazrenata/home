I am a community ecologist and macroecologist, currently a PhD candidate with [Weecology](https://www.weecology.org) at the University of Florida.

I study the biological and mathematical processes that generate emergent patterns in biodiversity and community structure, with a particular interest in how perturbations propagate across levels of organization and over time in ecological systems. 

I use a variety of approaches, including computationally- and data- intensive synthesis, long-term field experiments, and theoretical frameworks derived from ecology and complexity science. 

I believe strongly in the importance of open science, and I work to implement and disseminate best practices for open, replicable, and reproducible computational research.
