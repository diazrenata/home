I am a community ecologist and macroecologist, currently a PhD candidate with [Weecology](https://www.weecology.org) at the University of Florida. I study distributions of individuals, biomass, and energy use in ecological communities, and how those distributions change over time and following disturbance. I use large, cross-community and cross-system datasets and computationally intensive methods to look for common phenomena that may reflect general processes, and I make extensive use of null models and simulations to disentangle signals of ecological processes from patterns that emerge at random. I believe strongly in the importance of open science, and I work to implement and disseminate best practices for open, replicable, and reproducible computational research.
