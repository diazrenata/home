  abstract = {Exploring and accounting for the emergent properties of ecosystems as complex systems is a promising horizon in the search for general processes to explain common ecological patterns. For example the ubiquitous hollow-\-curve form of the species abundance distribution is frequently assumed to reflect ecological processes structuring communities, but can also emerge as a statistical phenomenon from the mathematical definition of an abundance distribution. Although the hollow curve may be a statistical artefact, ecological processes may induce subtle deviations between empirical species abundance distributions and their statistically most probable forms. These deviations may reflect biological processes operating on top of mathematical constraints and provide new avenues for advancing ecological theory. Examining \textasciitilde 22,000 communities, we found that empirical SADs are highly uneven and dominated by rare species compared to their statistical baselines. Efforts to detect deviations may be less informative in small communities\textemdash\-those with few species or individuals\textemdash\-because these communities have poorly resolved statistical baselines. The uneven nature of many empirical SADs demonstrates a path forward for leveraging complexity to understand ecological processes governing the distribution of abundance, while the issues posed by small communities illustrate the limitations of using this approach to study ecological patterns in small samples.},

  abstract = {Understanding the ecological processes that maintain community function in systems experiencing species loss, and how these processes change over time, is key to understanding the relationship between community structure and function and predicting how communities may respond to perturbations in the Anthropocene. Using a 30-year experiment on desert rodents, we show that the impact of species loss on community-level energy use has changed repeatedly and dramatically over time, due to (1) the addition of new species to the community, and (2) a reduction in functional redundancy among the same set of species. Although strong compensation, initially driven by the dispersal of functionally redundant species to the local community, occurred in this system from 1997 to 2010, since 2010, compensation has broken down due to decreasing functional overlap within the same set of species. Simultaneously, long-term changes in sitewide community composition due to niche complementarity have decoupled the dynamics of compensation from the overall impact of species loss on community-level energy use. Shifting, context-dependent compensatory dynamics, such as those demonstrated here, highlight the importance of explicitly long-term, metacommunity, and eco-evolutionary perspectives on the link between species-level fluctuations and community function in a changing world.},

  abstract = {Aim A core objective of contemporary biodiversity science is to understand long-term trends in the structure and function of ecological communities. Different currencies of ecological function \textendash{} specifically, total abundance, total standing biomass, and total metabolic flux \textendash{} are naturally linked, but may become decoupled if the underlying size structure of a system changes. Here, we seek to establish how changes in community size composition modulate long-term relationships between different currencies of ecological function for North American birds. Location North America, north of Mexico. Time period 1988-2018. Major taxa studied Breeding birds. Methods We used species' traits and allometric scaling to estimate individual size measurements and basal metabolic rate for birds observed in the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We compared the long-term trajectories for community-wide standing biomass and energy use to the long-term trends driven by changes in individual abundance alone. Finally, we used dissimilarity metrics to evaluate the link between changes in species and size composition and changes in the relationship between abundance- and size-driven dynamics. Results For a substantial minority of communities, shifts in community size composition have decoupled the long-term dynamics of biomass, energy use, and individual abundance. While trends in abundance were dominated by decreases, trends in biomass were evenly divided between decreases and increases, and trends in energy use featured more increases than expected given changes in abundance alone. Communities with decoupled dynamics showed greater increases in community-wide mean body size than other communities, but did not differ from other communities in overall turnover in species or size composition. Main conclusions Size- and abundance-based currencies of ecological function are linked, but not necessarily equivalent. For North American breeding birds, shifts in species composition favoring larger-bodied species may have partially offset declines in standing biomass driven by losses of individuals over the past 30 years.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, biology has undergone a data revolution in how researchers collect data and the amount of data being collected. An emerging challenge that has received limited attention in biology is managing, working with, and providing access to data under continual active collection. Regularly updated data present unique challenges in quality assurance and control, data publication, archiving, and reproducibility. We developed a workflow for a long-term ecological study that addresses many of the challenges associated with managing this type of data. We do this by leveraging existing tools to 1) perform quality assurance and control; 2) import, restructure, version, and archive data; 3) rapidly publish new data in ways that ensure appropriate credit to all contributors; and 4) automate most steps in the data pipeline to reduce the time and effort required by researchers. The workflow leverages tools from software development, including version control and continuous integration, to create a modern data management system that automates the pipeline.},
