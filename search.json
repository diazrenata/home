    "text": "Statistical baselines for ecological patterns\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon patterns in ecology - such as “hollow-curve” species abundance distributions, above - result from a combination of ecological processes and ubiquitous mathematical constraints on the emergent forms for abundance distributions in complex systems in general. Historically, these mathematical constraints have presented an obstacle to using these patterns to understand ecology - but they can also be a powerful tool for detecting and diagnosing strong disruptive processes at play in ecological systems. Deviations between real patterns and their idealized theoretical forms can reflect strong ecological processes. Isolating these deviations allows for stronger inference about ecology than trying to account for the general, mathematically-determined, pattern. Using data from >20,000 ecological communities, and a little bit of combinatorics, we have shown that empirical species abundance distributions are consistently much more uneven than would be expected given the statistical constraint."

    "text": "Ecological communites as nontraditional complex systems\nAt the same time, ecological systems are different from more traditional “complex” systems in physics and statistics, and may not play by the same rules that apply in those disciplines. Ecological systems are often small, with incomplete or imperfect observations of actual organisms, and constrained by their ecological and evolutionary histories. When we borrow theoretical approaches from other contexts, we need to adapt them to work with the idiosyncracies of ecological data. This can teach us about both ecology, and about how complex phenomena come to be in the first place and when and why they break down. Building on initial work with ecological abundance distributions (above), I am exploring how the nature and inferential power of mathematical constraints on abundance distributions varies across systems of different sizes and levels of sampling resolution."
