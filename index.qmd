I am an ecologist & data scientist. I try to understand, and ultimately predict, how ecological systems are responding to perturbations in the Anthropocene. I use a variety of approaches, including computationally- and data- intensive synthesis, cross-disciplinary statistical methods, and theoretical frameworks derived from ecology and complexity science. I believe strongly in the importance of open science, and I work to develop open-source software packages and train new users in best practices for open, reproducible computational research.
