I am a data scientist, with roots in field and computational ecology. I use a variety of approaches, including computationally- and data- intensive synthesis, cross-disciplinary statistical methods, and theoretical frameworks derived from ecology and complexity science. I believe strongly in the importance of open science, and I work to develop open-source software packages and train practitioners of all skills levels in best practices for open, reproducible computational research.
